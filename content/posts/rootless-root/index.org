** Editor's Introduction
The discovery of the collection of koans known as the Rootless Root,
apparently preserved for decades in the dry upper air of the Western
Mountains, has ignited great controversy in scholarly circles. Are these
authentic documents shedding new light on the teaching of the early Unix
patriarchs? Or are they clever pastiches from a later age, commanding
the authority of semi-mythical figures such as the Patriarchs Thompson,
Ritchie and McIlroy for doctrines which evolved closer to our own era?

It is impossible to say for certain. All sides in the dispute have made
much of an alleged similarity to that venerable classic,
[[#the-tao-of-programming][The Tao of Programming]]. But Rootless Root
is quite different in tone and style from the loose, poetic anecdotes of
the James translation, focused as it is on the remarkable and enigmatic
figure of Master Foo.

A newer work, [[#the-unix-power-clasic][the Unix Power Classic]], translates the Tao Te Ching into an
idiom similar to that of Rootless Root. Unix Power Classic may well have been
influenced by Rootless Root, or further research may disclose that they had
common sources.

It would be more apposite to seek parallels in the [[#ai-koans][AI Koans]];
indeed, there are textual clues that the author of the Rootless Root may
have redacted certain versions of the AI Koans. We are also on much
firmer ground in seeking connections with the [[#logintaka][Loginataka]]; indeed,
it is quite possible that the unknown authors of Rootless Root and of
Loginataka were one and the same person, possibly a student of Master
Foo himself.

Mention should also be made of the [[#tales-of-zen-master-greg][Tales of Zen Master Greg]], though
the Nine Inch Nails references have cast some doubt on their antiquity
and it is thus unlikely that they influenced Rootless Root.

A newer work, [[#the-unix-power-clasic][the Unix Power Classic]], translates the Tao Te Ching into an
idiom similar to that of Rootless Root. Unix Power Classic may well have been
influenced by Rootless Root, or further research may disclose that they had
common sources.

That the title of the work was intended as a reference to the Zen
classic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gateless_Barrier][Gateless Gate]] of Mumon, we can say with fair confidence.
There are echoes of Mumon in several of the koans.

There is considerable dispute over whether Master Foo should be assigned
to the Eastern (New Jersey) School, or the Western School that grew out
of the Patriarch Thompson's epochal early journey to Berkeley. If this
question has not been settled, it is perhaps because we cannot even
establish that Master Foo ever existed! He might merely be a composite
of a group of teachers, or of an entire dharma lineage.

Even supposing the legend of Master Foo accreted around the teaching of
some a single person, what of his favored student Nubi? Nubi has all the
earmarks of a stock figure, the perfect disciple. One is reminded of the
tales surrounding the Buddha's favorite follower Ananda. It seems likely
that there was a historical Ananda, but no trace of his actual
personality has survived the euhemerizing process by which the life of
the Buddha was polished into timeless myth.

In the end, all we can do is take these teaching stories on their own
terms, and extract what kernels of wisdom may be found there.

The redaction of the Rootless Root is a work in progress, as the source
materials present many difficulties in reconstruction and
interpretation. Future versions may include more stories as these
difficulties are overcome.

** Master Foo and the Ten Thousand Lines
Master Foo once said to a visiting programmer: "There is more Unix-nature in one
line of shell script than there is in ten thousand lines of C".

The programmer, who was very proud of his mastery of C, said: "How can this be?
C is the language in which the very kernel of Unix is implemented!"

Master Foo replied: "That is so. Nevertheless, there is more Unix-nature in one
line of shell script than there is in ten thousand lines of C".

The programmer grew distressed. "But through the C language we experience the
enlightenment of the Patriarch Ritchie! We become as one with the operating
system and the machine, reaping matchless performance!"

Master Foo replied: "All that you say is true. But there is still more
Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten thousand lines of
C".

The programmer scoffed at Master Foo and rose to depart. But Master Foo nodded
to his student Nubi, who wrote a line of shell script on a nearby whiteboard,
and said: "Master programmer, consider this pipeline. Implemented in pure C,
would it not span ten thousand lines?"

The programmer muttered through his beard, contemplating what Nubi had written.
Finally he agreed that it was so.

"And how many hours would you require to implement and debug that C program?"
asked Nubi.

"Many", admitted the visiting programmer. "But only a fool would spend the time
to do that when so many more worthy tasks await him".

"And who better understands the Unix-nature?" Master Foo asked. "Is it he who
writes the ten thousand lines, or he who, perceiving the emptiness of the task,
gains merit by not coding?"

Upon hearing this, the programmer was enlightened.

** Master Foo and the Script Kiddie
A stranger from the land of Woot came to Master Foo as he was eating the morning
meal with his students.

"I hear y00 are very l33t", he said. "Pl33z teach m3 all y00 know".

Master Foo's students looked at each other, confused by the stranger's barbarous
language. Master Foo just smiled and replied: "You wish to learn the Way of
Unix?"

"I want to b3 a wizard hax0r", the stranger replied, "and 0wn ever3one's b0xen".

"I do not teach that Way", replied Master Foo.

The stranger grew agitated. "D00d, y00 r nothing but a p0ser", he said. "If y00
n00 anything, y00 wud t33ch m3".

"There is a path", said Master Foo, "that might bring you to wisdom". The master
scribbled an IP address on a piece of paper. "Cracking this box should pose you
little difficulty, as its guardians are incompetent. Return and tell me what you
find".

The stranger bowed and left. Master Foo finished his meal.

Days passed, then months. The stranger was forgotten.

Years later, the stranger from the land of Woot returned.

"Damn you!" he said, "I cracked that box, and it was easy like you said. But I
got busted by the FBI and thrown in jail".

"Good", said Master Foo. "You are ready for the next lesson". He scribbled an IP
address on another piece of paper and handed it to the stranger.

"Are you crazy?" the stranger yelled. "After what I've been through, I'm never
going to break into a computer again!"

Master Foo smiled. "Here", he said, "is the beginning of wisdom".

On hearing this, the stranger was enlightened.
** Master Foo Discourses on the Two Paths
Master Foo instructed his students:

"There is a line of dharma teaching, exemplified by the Patriarch McIlroy's
mantra 'Do one thing well', which emphasizes that software partakes of the Unix
way when it has simple and consistent behavior, with properties that can be
readily modeled by the mind of the user and used by other programs".

"But there is another line of dharma teaching, exemplified by the Patriarch
Thompson's great mantra 'When in doubt, use brute force', and various sutras on
the value of getting 90% of cases right now, rather than 100% later, which
emphasizes robustness and simplicity of implementation".

"Now tell me: which programs have the Unix nature?"

After a silence, Nubi observed:

"Master, these teachings may conflict".

"A simple implementation is likely to lack logic for edge cases, such as
resource exhaustion, or failure to close a race window, or a timeout during an
uncompleted transaction".

"When such edge cases occur, the behavior of the software will become irregular
and difficult. Surely this is not the Way of Unix?"

Master Foo nodded in agreement.

"On the other hand, it is well known that fancy algorithms are brittle. Further,
each attempt to cover an edge case tends to interact with both the program's
central algorithms and the code covering other edge cases".

"Thus, attempts to cover all edge cases in advance, guaranteeing 'simplicity of
description', may in fact produce code that is overcomplicated and brittle or
which, plagued by bugs, never ships at all. Surely this is not the Way of Unix?"

Master Foo nodded in agreement.

"What, then, is the proper dharma path?" asked Nubi.

The master spoke:

"When the eagle flies, does it forget that its feet have touched the ground?
When the tiger lands upon its prey, does it forget its moment in the air? Three
pounds of VAX!"

On hearing this, Nubi was enlightened.
** Master Foo and the Methodologist
When Master Foo and his student Nubi journeyed among the sacred sites, it was
the Master's custom in the evenings to offer public instruction to Unix
neophytes of the towns and villages in which they stopped for the night.

On one such occasion, a methodologist was among those who gathered to listen.

"If you do not repeatedly profile your code for hot spots while tuning, you will
be like a fisherman who casts his net in an empty lake", said Master Foo.

"Is it not, then, also true", said the methodology consultant, "that if you do
not continually measure your productivity while managing resources, you will be
like a fisherman who casts his net in an empty lake?"

"I once came upon a fisherman who just at that moment let his net fall in the
lake on which his boat was floating", said Master Foo. "He scrabbled around in
the bottom of his boat for quite a while looking for it".

"But", said the methodologist, "if he had dropped his net in the lake, why was
he looking in the boat?"

"Because he could not swim", replied Master Foo.

Upon hearing this, the methodologist was enlightened.
** Master Foo Discourses on the Graphical User Interface
One evening, Master Foo and Nubi attended a gathering of programmers who had met
to learn from each other. One of the programmers asked Nubi to what school he
and his master belonged. Upon being told they were followers of the Great Way of
Unix, the programmer grew scornful.

"The command-line tools of Unix are crude and backward", he scoffed. "Modern,
properly designed operating systems do everything through a graphical user
interface".

Master Foo said nothing, but pointed at the moon. A nearby dog began to bark at
the master's hand.

"I don't understand you!" said the programmer.

Master Foo remained silent, and pointed at an image of the Buddha. Then he
pointed at a window.

"What are you trying to tell me?" asked the programmer.

Master Foo pointed at the programmer's head. Then he pointed at a rock.

"Why can't you make yourself clear?" demanded the programmer.

Master Foo frowned thoughtfully, tapped the the programmer twice on the nose,
and dropped him in a nearby trashcan.

As the programmer was attempting to extricate himself from the garbage, the dog
wandered over and piddled on him.

At that moment, the programmer achieved enlightenment.
** Master Foo and the Old Hand
An experienced Unix programmer, hearing of Master Foo's wisdom, came to him for
guidance. Approaching the Master, he bowed three times and said:

"Master Foo, I am gravely troubled. In my youth, those who followed the Great
Way of Unix used software that was simple and unaffected, like ed and mailx.
Today, they use vim and mutt. Tomorrow I fear they will use KMail and Evolution,
and Unix will have become like Windows — bloated and covered over with GUIs."

Master Foo said: "But what software do you use when you want to draw a poster?"

The programmer replied: "I...have never done that. But I am sure that I could
use LaTeX or pic to accomplish it without GUIs, in the proper Unix way."

Master Foo then said: "Which one will reach the other side of the river: The one
who dreams of a raft, or the one that hitchhikes to the next bridge?"

Upon hearing this, the programmer was enlightened.
** Master Foo and the Shell Tools
A Unix novice came to Master Foo and said: "I am confused. Is it not the Unix
way that every program should concentrate on one thing and do it well?"

Master Foo nodded.

The novice continued: "Isn't it also the Unix way that the wheel should not be
reinvented?"

Master Foo nodded again.

"Why, then, are there several tools with similar capabilities in text
processing: sed, awk and Perl? With which one can I best practice the Unix way?"

Master Foo asked the novice: "If you have a text file, what tool would you use
to produce a copy with a few words in it replaced by strings of your choosing?"

The novice frowned and said: "Perl's regexps would be excessive for so simple a
task. I do not know awk, and I have been writing sed scripts in the last few
weeks. As I have some experience with sed, at the moment I would prefer it. But
if the job only needed to be done once rather than repeatedly, a text editor
would suffice."

Master Foo nodded and replied: "When you are hungry, eat; when you are thirsty,
drink; when you are tired, sleep."

Upon hearing this, the novice was enlightened.
** Master Foo and the Nervous Novice
There was a novice who learned much at the Master's feet, but felt something to
be missing. After meditating on his doubts for some time, he found the courage
to approach Master Foo about his problem.

"Master Foo," he asked "why do Unix users not employ antivirus programs? And
defragmentors? And malware cleaners?"

Master Foo smiled, and said "When your house is well constructed, there is no
need to add pillars to keep the roof in place."

The novice replied "Would it not be better to use these things anyway, just to
be certain?"

Master Foo reached for a nearby ball of string, and began wrapping it around the
novice's feet.

"What are you doing?" the novice asked in surprise.

Master Foo replied simply: "Tying your shoes."

Upon hearing this, the novice was enlightened.
** Master Foo and the Recruiter
A technical recruiter, having discovered that that the ways of Unix hackers were
strange to him, sought an audience with Master Foo to learn more about the Way.
Master Foo met the recruiter in the HR offices of a large firm.

The recruiter said, "I have observed that Unix hackers scowl or become annoyed
when I ask them how many years of experience they have in a new programming
language. Why is this so?"

Master Foo stood, and began to pace across the office floor. The recruiter was
puzzled, and asked "What are you doing?"

"I am learning to walk," replied Master Foo.

"I saw you walk through that door" the recruiter exclaimed, "and you are not
stumbling over your own feet. Obviously you already know how to walk."

"Yes, but this floor is new to me." replied Master Foo.

Upon hearing this, the recruiter was enlightened.
** Master Foo Discourses on Returning to Windows
A student said: "We have learned that Unix is not just an operating system, but
also a style of approaching problems."

Master Foo nodded in agreement.

The student continued: "Then, the Great Way of Unix can be applied on other
operating systems?"

Master Foo sat silent for a moment, then said: "In every operating system there
is a path to the Great Way, if only we can find it."

The student continued: "What, then, of Windows? It is preinstalled on most
computers, and though its tools are mostly far inferior, they are easy to use
for beginners. Surely, Windows users could benefit from the Unix philosophy."

Master Foo nodded again.

The student said: "How, then, are those enlightened in the Unix Way to return to
the Windows world?"

Master Foo said: "To return to Windows, you have but to boot it up."

The student said, growing agitated: "Master Foo, if it is so easy, why are there
so many monolithic and broken software packages for Windows? Elegant software
should also be possible with a GUI and fancy colors, but there is little
evidence that this occurs. What becomes of an enlighted one who returns to
Windows?"

Master Foo: "A broken mirror never reflects again; fallen flowers never go back
to the old branches."

Upon hearing this, all present were enlightened.
** Master Foo and the Unix Zealot
A Unix zealot, having heard that Master Foo was wise in the Great Way, came to
him for instruction. Master Foo said to him:

"When the Patriarch Thompson invented Unix, he did not understand it. Then he
gained in understanding, and no longer invented it".

"When the Patriarch McIlroy invented the pipe, he knew that it would transform
software, but did not know that it would transform mind".

"When the Patriarch Ritchie invented C, he condemned programmers to a thousand
hells of buffer overruns, heap corruption, and stale-pointer bugs".

"Truly, the Patriarchs were blind and foolish!"

The zealot was greatly angered by the Master's words.

"These enlightened ones", he protested. "gave us the Great Way of Unix. Surely,
if we mock them we will lose merit and be reborn as beasts or MCSEs".

"Is your code ever completely without stain and flaw?" demanded Master Foo.

"No", admitted the zealot, "no man's is".

"The wisdom of the Patriarchs", said Master Foo, "was that they knew they were
fools".

Upon hearing this, the zealot was enlightened.
** Master Foo Discourses on the Unix-Nature
A student said to Master Foo: "We are told that the firm called SCO holds true
dominion over Unix".

Master Foo nodded.

The student continued, "Yet we are also told that the firm called OpenGroup also
holds true dominion over Unix".

Master Foo nodded.

"How can this be?" asked the student.

Master Foo replied:

"SCO indeed has dominion over the code of Unix, but the code of Unix is not
Unix. OpenGroup indeed has dominion over the name of Unix, but the name of Unix
is not Unix".

"What, then, is the Unix-nature?" asked the student.

Master Foo replied:

"Not code. Not name. Not mind. Not things. Always changing, yet never changing".

"The Unix-nature is simple and empty. Because it is simple and empty, it is more
powerful than a typhoon".

"Moving in accordance with the law of nature, it unfolds inexorably in the minds
of programmers, assimilating designs to its own nature. All software that would
compete with it must become like to it; empty, empty, profoundly empty,
perfectly void, hail!"

Upon hearing this, the student was enlightened.
** Master Foo and the MCSE
Once, a famous Windows system administrator came to Master Foo and asked him for
instruction: "I have heard that you are a powerful Unix wizard. Let us trade
secrets, that we may both gain thereby."

Master Foo said: "It is good that you seek wisdom. But in the Way of Unix, there
are no secrets."

The administrator looked puzzled at this. "But it is said that you are a great
Unix guru who knows all the innermost mysteries. As do I in Windows; I am an
MCSE, and I have many other certifications of knowledge not common in the world.
I know even the most obscure registry entries by heart. I can tell you
everything about the Windows API, yes, even secrets those of Redmond have
half-forgotten. What is the arcane lore that gives you your power?"

Master Foo said: "I have none. Nothing is hidden, nothing is revealed."

Growing angry, the administrator said "Very well, if you hold no secrets, then
tell me: what do I have to know to become as powerful in the Unix way as you?"

Master Foo said: "A man who mistakes secrets for knowledge is like a man who,
seeking light, hugs a candle so closely that he smothers it and burns his hand."

Upon hearing this, the administrator was enlightened.
** Master Foo and the End User
On another occasion when Master Foo gave public instruction, an end user, having
heard tales of the Master's wisdom, came to him for guidance.

He bowed three times to Master Foo. "I wish to learn the Great Way of Unix", he
said "but the command line confuses me".

Some of the onlooking neophytes began to mock the end user, calling him
"clueless" and saying that the Way of Unix is only for those of discipline and
intelligence.

The Master held up a hand for silence, and called the most obstreperous of the
neophytes who had mocked forward, to where he and the end user sat.

"Tell me", he asked the neophyte, "of the code you have written and the works of
design you have uttered".

The neophyte began to stammer out a reply, but fell silent.

Master Foo turned to the end-user. "Tell me", he inquired, "why do you seek the
Way?"

"I am discontent with the software I see around me", the end user replied. "It
neither performs reliably nor pleases the eye and hand. Having heard that the
Unix way, though difficult, is superior, I seek to cast aside all snares and
delusions".

"And what do you do in the world", asked Master Foo, "that you must strive with
software?"

"I am a builder", the end user replied, "Many of the houses of this town were
made under my chop".

Master Foo turned back to the neophyte. "The housecat may mock the tiger", said
the master, "but doing so will not make his purr into a roar".

Upon hearing this, the neophyte was enlightened.
** Master Foo and the Programming Prodigy
There was a time when rumors began to reach Master Foo and his students of a
prodigiously gifted programmer, a young man who wandered the length and breadth
of the land performing mighty feats of coding and humiliating all who dared set
their skill against his.

Eventually this prodigy came to visit Master Foo, who received him politely and
offered him tea. The Prodigy accepted with equal politeness and explained the
motive for his visit.

"I have come to you," he said "seeking a code and design review of my latest
project. For it is of surpassing complexity, and I do not have peers capable of
understanding it. Only an acknowledged master such as yourself (and here the
Prodigy bowed deeply) can have the discernment required."

Master Foo bowed politely in return and began examining the Prodigy's code.
After some time he raised his eyes from the screen. "This code is at first sight
very impressive," he said. "It is elegant in design, utilizing original
algorithms of great ingenuity, and appears to be implemented in a craftsmanlike
way which minimizes the possibility of errors."

The Prodigy looked very pleased at this praise, but Master Foo continued:
"However, I detect one significant flaw."

"Flaw?" the Prodigy said. "What flaw?"

"This code is difficult to read," said Master Foo. "It is only thinly commented,
its invariants are not specified, and I see no narrative description of its
architecture or internal data structures anywhere. These problems will seriously
impede your cooperation with other programmers."

The Prodigy drew himself up haughtily. "I do not seek the cooperation of other
programmers," he said. "Every time I thought I had found one who might match me
in skill I have been disappointed. Thus, I work alone."

"But even the hacker who works alone," said Master Foo, "collaborates with
others, and must constantly communicate clearly to them, lest his work become
confused and lost."

"Of what others do you speak?" the Prodigy demanded.

Master Foo said: "All your future selves."

Upon hearing this, the Prodigy was enlightened.
** Master Foo and the Hardware Designer
On one occasion, as Master Foo was traveling to a conference with a few of his
senior disciples, he was accosted by a hardware designer.

The hardware designer said: "It is rumored that you are a great programmer. How
many lines of code do you write per year?"

Master Foo replied with a question: "How many square inches of silicon do you
lay out per year?"

"Why...we hardware designers never measure our work in that way," the man said.

"And why not?" Master Foo inquired.

"If we did so," the hardware designer replied, "we would be tempted to design
chips so large that they cannot be fabricated - and, if they were fabricated,
their overwhelming complexity would make it be impossible to generate proper
test vectors for them."

Master Foo smiled, and bowed to the hardware designer.

In that moment, the hardware designer achieved enlightenment.

** The Unix Power Classic: A book about the Unix Way and its power
This is [[http://ccil.org/~cowan][my]] evolving [[http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/hacker.html][hacker]]-oriented version of the Dao De Jing (literally "way
power classic").

Disclaimer: I don't actually know any Chinese. I'm working from Jonathan Star's
[[http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1585420999][Verbatim Translation]], an amazingly helpful spreadsheet in book form giving
character-by-character glosses for each of the 5000-odd characters of the Dao De
Jing. I'm also using the online Chinese text with clickable characters at
[[http://zhongwen.com/dao.htm][zhongwen.com]].

Not much is known for sure about the Dao De Jing, except that it's Chinese, it's
very old, and people have loved it for twenty-five hundred years, as [[http://www.ursulakleguin.com/][Ursula K.
LeGuin]] says in [[http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1570623953][her version]], which I dearly love.

But I will say this much. The Dao De Jing can be given philosophical
interpretations, political interpretations, religious interpretations. In some
translations the original sinks under the weight of them. But it has survived
and is read today because it is, at bottom, immortal poetry, as beautiful and
meaningful as any that humanity has ever known.

Here are the 81 chapters (or the ones I've written so far) in the usual order.
Book One ("The Way") comprises chapters 1-37; Book Two ("Its Power") comprises
chapters 38-81.

Here's a [[http://www.americantanka.com/about.html][tanka]] I wrote belonging to the same tradition:

The route you can traverse
  isn't a static route.
The name you can dereference
  isn't a universal name.

Namelessness is the root of everything.
Names are the mother of everything.

Therefore,
  the unchanging, seen from outside the box,
    reveals its inner nature;
  the unchanging, seen from inside the box,
    reveals its outer form.

These two are alike in origin,
  but different in name.
Their unity is called "the mystery".

Mystery of all mysteries,

Unix is a cauldron,
   yet when it's in use,
   it's somehow never exhausted.

Deep, indeed;
   it seems to be the source
   of the ten thousand apps.

Rounding off its sharpness,
   resolving its confusions,
   tempering its brilliance,
   it becomes one with the mundane.

Deep, indeed;
   it seems likely to endure.

I do not know whose child it is;
   in imagination, it existed

Design is everlasting,
content is enduring.

What's the reason that design and content
  can be everlasting and enduring?

Because they don't exist in themselves;
  thus they exist forever.

For this reason, the hacker
  is behind himself
  and in front of himself.

He rejects his ego and his ego is preserved.
Is this not because he lacks ego?
Isn't that why he can perfect himself?

The highest Quality is like water.

Water Quality benefits everything,

(It flows down to everyone's pisshole;

A house has Quality if it's level,
thinking has Quality if it's deep,
relationships have Quality if they're decent,
speaking has Quality if it's sincere,
management has Quality if it's just,
work has Quality if it's competent,
action has Quality if it's timely.

Above all, these things don't compete,

Finish the job and move on,

The hackers of the Elder Days
   cultivated mastery:
   the subtle essence,
   deep, penetrating, profound, hairy.

And so we cannot understand them.

As a best effort, therefore,
  I wil describe their appearance:

They were cautious as the elephant,
  like one making global changes to a codebase.

They were vigilant as the monkey,
  yes, like a rogue(6) player fearing danger from all quarters.

They were courteous,
  like ITS turists.

They were egoless, yes,
  like ice which is just about to crack.

They were solid, yes, like GNU utilities.

They were open, yes, like a newly formatted disk.

They were opaque, like spaghetti code.

Who can make spaghetti code straightforward?
  It gradually clarifies itself.

Who can make dead code useful again?
  It gradually rejuvenates itself.

Holding to the Unix Way,
  one doesn't long
  for more and more features.

Truly, therefore, one is compact,
  and can remain stable
  without gratuitous changes.

The greatest project leaders
   hardly make their presence known.

Next best are those
   who are loved and honored.

Next come those who are feared.

Next the PHBs, who are despised.

The demand to be trusted is not enough;
  indeed, it finds no trust.

The true leader shuts up and shows us the code.

Then when the tasks are accomplished,
   and the project is complete,
   all the contributors say,
   "We did it ourselves."

When the way of Unix is forgotten,
   "team players" and "professionalism" appear.
When ego and cleverness dominate,
   the codebase becomes a pile of cruft.
When the team has not jelled,
   "vision statements" and "objective-setting" are all we hear of.
When the startup is heading for the rocks,
   the talk is of "company loyalty" and "management by exception".

Power's nature is to be great
  iff it follows the Way.
The Way is the real thing
  iff it is waxing,
  iff it is waning.

Waxing, oh!
Waning, oh!
  Its kernel holds the classes.
Waning, oh!
Waxing, oh!
  Its kernel holds the objects.
Profound, oh!
Obscure, oh!
  Its kernel holds the essence.

This essence is very real;
  its kernel holds the truth.

From now back to the Elder Days,
  its name has never been lost.

Thus it tracks the common source.
How do I grok the common source?
By this.

A few words about the matter:

Flames don't outlast the message,
Flamewars don't outlast the thread.
What are the causes of these?
  The total system.

If the works of the total system
   can't last forever,
how much less can anyone else's, in fact?

So do business with Unix people.

Unix people are one with Unix,
Power people are one with Power,
(Lusers are one with Lossage.)

Being one with Unix people,
  Unix must be happy with them.
Power too is happy with them.
(Even being one with lusers counts.)

Trusting's not enough, in fact;
Having's not trusting, either.

Knowing its rigor,
   holding on to its flexibility,
   the system becomes a river.

When the system becomes a river,
   stable power will not be lost
   when looping back to the design stage.

Knowing its clarity,
   holding on to its profundity,
   the system becomes a pattern.

Stable power will not go astray
   when jumping forward to the extreme.

Knowing its pride,
   holding on to its humility,
   the system becomes a valley.

When the system becomes a valley,
   stable power will return to the unwritten code.

When the unwritten code is shattered,
   it becomes the utilities.

When the hacker makes use of them,
   then the team leaders last long.

Thus the great carving does not divide.

Unix is pervasive!
  It runs on any platform.

The ten thousand apps rely on it;
  it gives them life,
  but doesn't dominate them.

When the job is done,
   Unix doesn't take credit for it.

It supports the ten thousand apps,
   but doesn't claim to own them.

Free of imposed paradigms,
   it can be called "the flexible".

The ten thousand apps run on it,
   but don't control it,
   so it can be named "the powerful".

Because it never dominates,
   it can achieve dominance.

Design power was one, thus clear.
Coding power was one, thus calm.
Testing power was one, thus energized.
Refactoring power was one, thus fulfilled.
Contributor power was one, thus alive.
Leader power was one, thus world-dominating.

What made it so?

Without design, the clear would be afraid and split open.
Without coding, the calm would be afraid and shake to pieces.
Without testing, the energized would be afraid and wither away.
Without refactoring, the fulfilled would be afraid and be exhausted.
Without contributors, life would be afraid and perish.
Without leaders, trust and merit would be afraid and stumble.

For trust, humility is the root.
For merit, humility is the base class.

The Old Hackers called themselves

Thoughtful hackers hear about Unix

Ordinary hackers hear about Unix
   and mess about with it a little.
Thoughtless hackers hear about Unix
   and crack wise about it.
It wouldn't be Unix
   if there weren't wisecracks about it.

So we establish the following rules:

The most brilliant Unix seems the most obscure.
Advanced Unix seems like retrocomputing.
The most powerful code seems like just loops and conditionals.
The clearest code seems to be opaque.
The sharpest tools seem inadequate.
Solid code seems flaky.
Stable code seems to change.

Great methodologies don't have boundaries.
Great talent doesn't code fast.
Great music makes no sound.
The ideal elephant has no shape.
The Unix Way has no name.

Yet for just this reason

Unix begat the kernel;

This combination makes harmony.

People detest geeks, nerds, and dweebs,
and yet hackers and wizards use these titles.

Thus, perhaps, things lose but something wins.

      the cubicles are bare.

Dressed in their elegant suits,

Use justice to run a project.
Use surprise to run a company.
Use non-interference to achieve world domination.
By what do I know this is so, indeed?

By this:

When the world is full of
  restrictions and prohibitions,
  the people grow poorer.

When the companies have
  many fast-talking lawyers,
  the world grows more and more troubled.

When the geeks abound in
  clever techniques,
  abnormal things more and more occur.

When law and order becomes
  more and more evident,
  more robbers and thieves appear.

So the hacker says:

I do without doing,
  and the people spontaneously transform themselves.

I prefer quiet,
  and the people are spontaneously fair.

I don't interfere,
  and the people are spontaneously wealthy.

I am not greedy,

manage big projects while they're small.

In this world,
  difficult problems surely arise
  from what is easy;
in this world,
  big systems surely begin
  in what is small.

Thus the hacker doesn't set big goals,

An appendix to the Jargon file, usually found at [[http://www.catb.org/~esr//jargon/html/koans.html][catb.org]] by [[http://www.catb.org/~esr/][ESR]]
#+end_quote
These are some of the funniest examples of a genre of jokes told at the MIT AI
Lab about various noted hackers. The original koans were composed by Danny
Hillis, who would later found Connection Machines, Inc. In reading these, it is
at least useful to know that Minsky, Sussman, and Drescher are AI researchers of
note, that Tom Knight was one of the Lisp machine's principal designers, and
that David Moon wrote much of Lisp Machine Lisp.
** Tom Knight and the Lisp Machine
A novice was trying to fix a broken Lisp machine by turning the power off and
on.

Knight, seeing what the student was doing, spoke sternly: "You cannot fix a
machine by just power-cycling it with no understanding of what is going wrong."

Knight turned the machine off and on.

The machine worked.
** Moon instructs a student
One day a student came to Moon and said: "I understand how to make a better
garbage collector. We must keep a reference count of the pointers to each cons."

Moon patiently told the student the following story:

    "One day a student came to Moon and said: 'I understand how to make a better
    garbage collector...

[Ed. note: Pure reference-count garbage collectors have problems with circular
structures that point to themselves.]
** Sussman attains enlightenment In the days when Sussman was a novice, Minsky
once came to him as he sat hacking at the PDP-6.   "What are you doing?", asked
Minsky.   "I am training a randomly wired neural net to play Tic-Tac-Toe"
Sussman replied.   "Why is the net wired randomly?", asked Minsky.   "I do not
want it to have any preconceptions of how to play", Sussman said.   Minsky then
shut his eyes.   "Why do you close your eyes?", Sussman asked his teacher.   "So
that the room will be empty."   At that moment, Sussman was enlightened.
** Drescher and the toaster
A disciple of another sect once came to Drescher as he was eating his morning
meal.

"I would like to give you this personality test", said the outsider, "because I
want you to be happy."

Drescher took the paper that was offered him and put it into the toaster,
saying: "I wish the toaster to be happy, too."

*** Speak, O Guru: How can I become a Unix Wizard?
O, Nobly Born: know that the Way to Wizardhood is long, and winding, and Fraught with Risks. Thou must Attune thyself with the Source, attaining the arcane Knowledge and Conversation of the System Libraries and Internals. Yea; and such an all-consuming Time and Energy Sink is this as to greatly Imperil thy Grade Point Average (if one thou hast), not to mention thy Sex Life (if one thou hast). But persevere, oh Larval One; rewards beyond the Dreams of Lusers await thee!

*** Speak, O Guru: What books should I study? Are the O'Reilly "Nutshell" guides a good place to start?
O, Nobly Born: know that the Nutshell Guides are but the outermost Portal of the True Enlightenment. Worthy are they (and praise to the Name of O'Reilly, whose books show forth the Hacker Spirit in numerous pleasing ways), but the Nutshell Guides are only the Beginning of the Road.

If thou desirest with True Desire to tread the Path of Wizardly Wisdom, first learn the elementary Postures of Kernighan & Pike's The Unix Programming Environment; then, absorb the mantic puissance of March Rochkind's Advanced Unix Programming and W. Richard Stevens's Advanced Programming In The Unix Environment.

Immerse thyself, then, in the Pure Light of Maurice J. Bach's The Design Of The Unix Operating System. Neglect not the Berkelian Way; study also The Design and Implementation Of The 4.4BSD Operating System by Kirk McKusick, Keith Bostic et. al.

For useful hints, tips, and tricks, see Unix Power Tools, Tim O'Reilly, ed. Consider also the dark Wisdom to be gained from contemplation of the dread Portable C And Unix Systems Programming, e'en though it hath flowed from the keyboard of the mad and doomed Malvernite whom the world of unknowing Man misnames "J. E. Lapin".

These tomes shall instruct thy Left Brain in the Nature of the Unix System; to Feed the other half of thy Head, O Nobly Born, embrace also the Lore of its Nurture. Don Libes's and Sandy Ressler's Life With Unix will set thy Feet unerringly upon that Path; take as thy Travelling Companion the erratic but illuminating compendium called The New Hacker's Dictionary (Eric S. Raymond, ed., with Guy L. Steele Jr.).

(In this wise shalt thou travel the Way of the Camel.)
*** Speak, O Guru: To attain Mastery, how many Kernels do I need to take apart and reassemble?
O Nobly Born: this question reveals that indeed thou hast touched upon an Ineffable Truth about Unix --- that thou canst not Plumb its Mysteries by mere Study but must become One with it through Practice. The true Way to the Knowledge of the Source is not the timid and footling way of the Student, but the Divine Foolery of the Hacker. Hack, then; strive against Mighty Problems, have joy in thy Striving, and let the Crashes fall where they may (maintaining the while, for the Good of thy Karma, a Rigorous Backup Policy).

In this day of Boot-Time Autoconfiguration and Dynamically Loadable Device Drivers, reassembling a Kernel is no longer the daunting Test and Seal of Mastery that once it was. However, writing and verifying thine own Device Driver for some piece of Exotic Hardware is still a worthy challenge to thy Budding Guruhood. Indeed, such Challenge may be found the Crafting of any Program sufficiently Powerful to Extend or Compete with the Tools now available in Open Source.

Therefore: seek thee out the Open Source Unixes: OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and most Especially Linux in many of its Incarnations. Join the Wizards and Aspirants to Wizardhood who Labor Unceasingly to Improve these. Commune with them in their Great Work, their unceasing Extension and Reinvention of Unix. In this wise may thou become one among the Mighty.
*** Speak, O Guru: Some there are who claim that the sole Path to Wizardry and the proper Way of every Right-Thinking Hacker is to rewrite the Unix Kernel from Scratch. Is this not Sacrilege?


Sacrilege, O Nobly Born? Nay! Certainly the Kernel Source is the Inmost Mystery of Unix --- but there is a Mystery beyond that Mystery. The Nature of Unix inhereth not in any one Version but in the Design Tradition of which all Unixes are Evolving Parts.

The Rite of the Rewrite is not the only Path to Mastery, but it is perhaps the highest and most Sacred of all Paths. Few indeed are those who, travelling it, have crossed the dark and yawning Abyss of Implementation to Delivery. Many, yea, many in truth stagnate yet in the Desert of Delay, or linger ever in the ghastly limbo called Perpetual Beta.

(In this wise shalt thou travel the Way of the Lion.)
*** Speak, O Guru: What, then, is the True Path to Wizardhood?
O Nobly Born: learn, and seek within thyself. Cultivate the cunning of the Serpent and the courage of the Tiger; sup deeply from the Wisdom of those who came before thee. Hack, and hack again; grow, by trial and by error. Post thy best hacks to the Net and gain in Repute thereby. Also, O Nobly Born, be thou grave and courteous in thy speech; be helpful to those less than thee, quick to succour and slow to flame.

If thou dost these things faithfully, if thou travellest with high heart and pure intention, soon shall thy callow Newbiehood be shed. By degrees imperceptible to thyself shalt thou gain Power and Wisdom, Striving and Doing all the while. Gradually shall thy Puissance unfold and deepen.

O Nobly Born, if thou dost all these things, thy Wizardhood shall surely come upon thee; but not of a sudden, and not until after thy arrogant Mind hath more than half Forgotten that such was its Aim. For know this --- you may not by thyself in Pride claim the Mantle of Wizardry; that way lies only Bogosity without End.

Rather must you Become, and Become, and Become, until Hackers respect thy Power, and other Wizards hail thee as a Brother or Sister in Wisdom, and you wake up and realize that the Mantle hath lain unknown upon thy Shoulders since you knew not when.

(In this wise shalt thou travel the Way of the Child.)

Hear, O nobly born: Techniques can be taught, but the Way of the Hacker cannot be taught. Skills can be acquired, but the Way of the Hacker is not a checklist of skills. Programming can be accomplished, but the Way of the Hacker is not a place at which you can stop and say "I have arrived!"

Hear, O nobly born: The Way of the Hacker is a posture of mind; he who seeks a teacher of the Way knows it not, but he is only looking for a mirror. All those competent to teach the Way know that it cannot be taught, only pursued with joyous labor and by emulation of the great hackers of the past.

Hear, O nobly born: Great were the hackers of the past! Subtle and deep in their thinking, shaggy-bearded and with thunder on their brows! You may seek to become as them, but it will not suffice you to grow a beard.

Hear, O Nobly Born: The center of the mystery is the act of coding. You have a keyboard before you; pursue the Way through work.

** Annotations
Most of this (up to "(In this wise shalt thou travel the Way of the Child.)") was originally a Usenet response to some eager newbie questions; it appears that I wrote it on 21 November 1992 in response to a post by one Ade Barkah. After ten years, I guess it's time to draw aside the veil of those mysteries. The remainder I wrote in 2010 after I was actually asked to give an answer in the style of the Loginataka.

For those of you who are not native English speakers, the entirety is written in imitation of the Early Modern English of the late 1500s and early 1600s, the language of the King James Bible. The influence of the King James Bible is such that its dialect has retained connotations of majesty, solemnity, and religious authority. Holy scriptures from other languages are, therefore, often translated into a KJB-like pseudo-archaic English rather than following modern usage.
Parts of this border on obsolescence now. Portable C And Unix Systems Programming has been out of print for a long time, but the Lovecraft joke was too funny to lose. Life With Unix is history, too, but the other references are still good. In 1998 I changed references to "freeware" and "free software" to "open source". Otherwise changes have been pretty minor.
- "Loginataka"
  - The title of the document is a play on the name of the Tripitaka, an early
    compilation of Buddhist scriptures.
- "Oh Nobly Born:"
  - The formulaic use of the salutation is intended to be reminiscent of the
    Bardo Thödöl — the Tibetan Book Of The Dead.
- "the Name of O'Reilly"
  - A phrase rich with meaning in the clan system of old Scotland and Ireland.
    It might refer to the reputation of the clan O'Reilly, or to the person of
    the clan chief. The implied image is of Tim O'Reilly, be-tartaned,
    surrounded by louring Celts bristling with weapons. It's worth noting that
    O'Reilly and Associates was pretty new at the game when I wrote this; it was
    over the following five years that they built up their remarkable reputation
    as friends of the hacker community.
- "attaining the arcane Knowledge and Conversation"
  - This is a reference to the occultism of Alesteir Crowley. He wrote of
    attaining the "Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel" as the
    central aim of Thelemic mysticism, and added that he had chosen that term
    for it because it was the most absurd locution he could think of.
- "the Pure Light"
  - In Buddhist mysticism, the Pure Light of the Void ("void" being the usual
    English translation of Sanskrit sunyata) is a frequent metaphor for the
    wisdom that comes from realizing the emptiness of all things.
- "the Berkelian Way"
  - If you caught the previous reference to sunyata, you might also recall that
    Bishop Berkeley famously denied the existence of objective reality.
- "the mad and doomed Malvernite"
  - This is a play on H.P. Lovecraft's "mad and doomed Arab", Abdul al-Hazred,
    the author of the Necronomicon. And the actual doomed Malvernite
    was...er...me, in 1987. The "world of unknowing man misnames" because I
    wrote the book, but was pressured into allowing it to be published under a
    corporate pseudonym.
- "feed the other half of thy head"
  - Cue Grace Slick, in the last lines of Jefferson Airplane's White Rabbit, a
    song about a hallucinogenic drug experience: "Remember...what the dormouse
    said! FEED YOUR HEAD! FEED YOUR HEAD!"
- "the Way of the Camel"
  - The references to the Ways of the Camel, Lion, and Child are to a mystical
    rant in Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra.
- "Divine Foolery of the Hacker"
  - The image of the Fool of God is a pervasive one in world mysticism. I was
    thinking here especially of the Fool card in the Rider-Waite Tarot, showing
    a clown walking or capering at the edge of a precipice.
- "Great Work"
  - In alchemy, the production of the Philosopher's Stone that could transmute
    lead to gold, confer immortality. In some mystical interpretations of
    alchemy, the transmutation of the adept's own soul. Modern Hermetic
    occultism generalizes the second meaning.
- "Desert of Delay"
  - This part is intended to recall the landscapes in Bunyan's moral allegory
    Pilgrim's Progress.
- "cunning of the Serpent and the courage of the Tiger"
  - In the New Testament of the Christian Bible, Matthew 10:16 exhorts
    Christians to be as cunning as serpents and as harmless as doves. This in
    turn refers to the "cunning of the serpent" in the Old Testament Book of
    Genesis.
- "if thou travellest with high heart and pure intention"
  - In the Egyptian Book Of The Dead, "I have travelled here with high heart and
    pure intention" is part of the ritual one must speak to pass the Weigher of
    Souls.
- "Shantih!"
  - "Shanti!" is Sanskrit and means "Peace!" I deliberately used the older
    transliteration "Shantih!" because it's found at the end of T.S. Eliot's
    poem The Wasteland. The threefold repetition is a form of invocatory magic
    closely equivalent to the Catholic ritual blessing "Peace be with you!"

disk and I don't have a backup and HEY! WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU GOING? AND WHAT
ABOUT MY DISK! ARGH! MY DISK! YOU SNAPPED MY DISK AND THREW IT OUT THE WINDOW!
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON! ARE YOU INSANE? THAT'S ALL MY WORK. WHAT KIND OF
MORON ARE YOU?

*Zen-Master Greg*: You are welcome, misguided one. This matter will trouble you
no more.
** In which the Master takes a hands-on approach.
 *Customer*: Hey, I've got a problem. Are you listening to me? Are you even
 awake? Hello? I've got a problem.

*Zen-Master Greg*: One moment while I contemplate the infinite.

*Customer*: But you're playing tetris?

*Zen-Master Greg*: The ant looks, but it does not see. What is the nature of
this so-called problem?

*Customer*: Look, I've got a problem, okay? Can you just come and help? Now?

*Zen-Master Greg*: Truly you may be said to have a problem. But I despair of
solving it. Let us examine the symptoms.

*Customer*: See, it doesn't work. I type and nothing happens.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Truly a puzzling situation. Tell me, unlearned one, what does
it say on the mystic screen?

*Customer*: It says "please insert the disk: Untitled". But what's wrong?

*Zen-Master Greg*: My son, have you chanced to remove a disk from the drive?

*Customer*: Yes.

*Zen-Master Greg*: And have you chosen to favour this disk with a name?

*Customer*: Um, no.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Let us then insert this disk, in the hope that the hunger of
the computer may be satisfied.

*Customer*: Okay, if you say so. Hey, it works!

*Zen-Master Greg*: Truly, your comprehension is beyond understanding.

(5 minutes pass)

*Customer*: Hi, it's me again! Remember?

*Zen-Master Greg*: The memory is as a blade in my soul.

*Customer*: Can you come and help me? It's stopped working again.

*Zen-Master Greg*: And did it in any way indicate distress?

*Customer*: Well, it did say something on the screen.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Tell me, grasshopper, what it happens to say on the screen.

*Customer*: You know, the damn thing said the same as last time.

*Zen-Master Greg*: And did you insert the disk?

*Customer*: No. Should I try that?

*Zen-Master Greg*: The fool must be beaten with a stick, for an intelligent
person the merest hint is sufficient.

*Customer*: Yeah, well. I'll try it anyway. Hey! It worked!

(5 more minutes go by)

*Customer*: Hey buddy?

*Zen-Master Greg*: It is a fool who walks unknowing over the abyss.

*Customer*: Look, cut the poetry. I've got a problem. Come and help.

*Zen-Master Greg*: You have followed the mystic rituals?

*Customer*: It just doesn't work. Fix it.

*Zen-Master Greg*: The ox complains not of its burden. Am I less than an ox?

*Customer*: See. Nothing I type comes up.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Truly a vexing problem. A most strenuous solution is called
for. Let us perform the ritual of re-boot.

*Customer*: What's that?

*Zen-Master Greg*: Some things one may not know.

*Customer*: Hey, what's that whirring noise?

*Zen-Master Greg*: Tell me, my son. Did you try to fix the computer?

*Customer*: Yes.

*Zen-Master Greg*: And did you try to fix it by sating its hunger?

*Customer*: Yeah, so?

*Zen-Master Greg*: And was there not already a disk in the drive when you tried
this?

*Customer*: Yeah, but that's what we did before.

*Zen-Master Greg*: One does not achieve enlightenment by copying the actions of
the master.

*Customer*: Cut the crap. I'm working on something that's due in in an hour and
the damn computers keep breaking down. Can you begin to do your job and make
sure that nothing else goes wrong?

*Zen-Master Greg*: For the master, all things are possible.

*Customer*: Well do it then. God knows, we're paying enough for all of this
crap. And for your salary.

*Zen-Master Greg*: I will prevent further problems.

*Customer*: Well about damn time! AAAARRRRGGGGHHHHH!

(sound of the Master drawing a hatchet from beneath his robes and chopping off
the customer's hand at the wrist, then picking it up and stuffing it into the
luser's mouth)

*Customer*: AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHH <SPTH!>

*Zen-Master Greg*: The problem will not recur.

*And the luser was enlightened*
** In which the Master resorts to mantras.
*Zen-Master Greg*: Bow down before the one you serve.

*Customer*: Um, excuse me?

*Zen-Master Greg*: You're going to get what you deserve.

*Customer*: Ah, hello?

*Zen-Master Greg*: Greetings child. Let me turn down the mantras. Now, what is
your request?

*Customer*: I have a problem.

*Zen-Master Greg*: This is so. But what do _you_ believe your problem is?

*Customer*: Well what do you think it is?

*Zen-Master Greg*: You are not ready for the knowledge.

*Customer*: Oh. Okay. My disk is stuck.

*Zen-Master Greg*: And?

*Customer*: What do you mean, "and".

*Zen-Master Greg*: I seek the completed statement. I wonder what the disk has to
do with me.

*Customer*: I want you to fix it.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Truly has it been said that one can't always get what one
wants. For lo, I have been perusing my job description and stuck disks are in no
way mentioned.

*Customer*: When's Pete going to be around?

*Zen-Master Greg*: But there is no need to trouble the great sage at this time,
for lo, I feel moved to help you. Let us seek the cause of this sticking.

*Customer*: See, it's stuck.

*Zen-Master Greg*: "Stuck" is but a transient condition, having no meaning for
those in timeless existence. Yet I will fetch the official disk extraction tool.

*Customer*: That's a paperclip.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Ah, you are right. I will fetch the tool.

*Customer*: Hey, that's still a paperclip.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Truly you know all.

*Customer*: Where are you going?

*Zen-Master Greg*: Every time I enter with the disk extraction tool, you are
moved to remark that it is a paperclip, and I look down and it has become so. It
is truly confusing. I go to listen to the mantras. Especially the one entitled
"Head Like A Hole".

*Customer*: Are you trying to be funny?

*Zen-Master Greg*: What is there to laugh at?

*Customer*: Well, all right. But what about my disk.

*Zen-Master Greg*: I shall take the disk extraction tool...

*Customer*: But that's a... oh.

*Zen-Master Greg*: and I shall extract the disk.

*Customer*: Nothing is happening.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Your wisdom is like vision from the corner of the eye. It
seems to exist, but disappears when examined.

*Customer*: So what are we going to do?

*Zen-Master Greg*: The situation calls for extreme philosophical measures.

(5 minutes pass)

*Zen-Master Greg*: Head like a hole, black as your soul, I'd rather die than
give you control!

*Customer*: What the hell are you doing? You're supposed to be helping me!

*Zen-Master Greg*: Have I not resorted to philosophy to do so?

*Customer*: What are you talking about?

*Zen-Master Greg*: Is the disk stuck in the drive?

*Customer*: Yes.

*Zen-Master Greg*: If the tree falls in the forest, and no one is in the area,
does it make a sound?

*Customer*: Yes.

*Zen-Master Greg*: I shall ask again. If the tree falls in the forest, and no
one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?

*Customer*: Um. No?

(The master reaches into his robe, thinks for a moment, then reluctantly
withdraws his hand)

*Zen-Master Greg*: If the tree falls in the forest, and no one hears it, then
does it make a sound?

*Customer*: I DON'T KNOW!

*Zen-Master Greg*: Correct on all counts. Without knowledge, the state of
affairs is indeterminate.

*Customer*: And like this has anything to do with my disk.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Can you see the disk?

*Customer*: No, it's in the other room.

*Zen-Master Greg*: How do you know? It may not be. I may have it in my hand.

*Customer*: Hey, that's a neat trick. Give it to me.

*Zen-Master Greg*: I don't actually have it, but while it is unobserved, I might
have. While it is not seen being stuck, it is not. And since the disk is not
stuck, there is no problem.

*Customer*: But I still don't have it.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Then the original question was faulty. And I have laboured
enough this day. Yet hark! Here comes the sage. Mayhap he will soil his hands to
help you.

*Sage*: There is a problem?

*Customer*: Yes!

*Sage*: I know all. Let us examine this problem.

(5 minutes pass)

*Sage*: I shall require a disk extraction tool.

(5 minutes pass)

*Sage*: Truly a vexing problem. I shall require my toolkit.

(10 minutes pass)

*Sage*: Truly a DEU problem. I shall require some mantras and a punching bag.

(5 minutes pass)

*Sage*: Here is your disk.

*Customer*: Thank you, O sage!

*Zen-Master Greg*: May I enquire as to the nature of the illusory problem, O
sage?

*Sage*: Yes my child. The problem was in the nature of the inserted disk. It
seems that the unlearned one had covered the high-density notch of the disk.

*Zen-Master Greg*: And the nature of this substance, which had presumably become
attached to the inside of the drive.

*Sage*: Duct tape, my child.

*Zen-Master Greg*: DUCT TAPE! THAT LUSER COVERED A DISK IN DUCT... I mean, the
unlearned one was so foolish as to tamper with substances beyond his power?

*Sage*: Yes my child.

*Zen-Master Greg*: What an idiot.

*Sage*: Truly it is so.

*Customer*: Well I'm going now. And I'm going to make a complaint. You haven't
been at all pleasant and you've deliberately set out to embarass me.

*Zen-Master Greg*: May I borrow the punching bag, O sage?

*Sage*: It appears to have become broken, my child. I fear we shall have to get
more from storage.

*Zen-Master Greg*: It is well that we get them in bulk.

*Sage*: Truly, my child. Turn up the mantras.

** In which the Master instructs the young.

In Chaos and riots,

The screech of machines,

No right and no wrong,

And no in-betweens.

Is this work music or what? Still, five times through is enough, and it's time
to slot in "Fixed", kick up the volume a little bit (a little bit is all that's
left) and participate in another of the frenzied memories that leave me
shuddering.

*Customer A*: Do you think he's awake?

*Customer B*: Nah, he's asleep.

*Customer A*: Well, should we wake him up?

*Zen-Master Greg*: My child, there is no need.

*Customer A*: Who said that?

*Zen-Master Greg*: I did, my child. I was merely resting my eyes.

*Customer B*: While snoring?

*Zen-Master Greg*: A mystic breathing exercise. What is your query?

*Customer A*: Oh, we just wanted to know if you were awake.

*Zen-Master Greg*: You are now closer to enlightenment. Go in peace, my
children. Now.

*Customer A*: Why do you keep calling us that?

*Zen-Master Greg*: To what do you refer, child?

*Customer A*: That! You keep calling us 'child' and 'children'.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Are you not?

*Customer A*: No way! I'm 15 and he's 16. So cut it out.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Truly, I am far from enlightenment and the terms were not in
the least appropriate. I shall endeavour to better suit my address to your
luminous natures.

*Customer A*: Good.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Is there anything else?

*Customer A*: No we'll be fine. We're both computer experts.

(5 minutes later)

*Customer A*: Are you asleep again?

*Zen-Master Greg*: Your presence wearies me. Speak before I am tried beyond
endurance.

*Customer A*: Oh, okay. Um, my friend wants to know of some ftp-sites where he
can get some games. Can you help?

*Zen-Master Greg*: Surely. Try wuarchive.wustl.edu, and ftp.midnight.com

*Customer A*: Thanks. Ah, can you write those down?

*Zen-Master Greg*: It is a pleasure to help those lesser than one's self.

*Customer A*: Thank you.

(5 minutes later)

*Customer A*: Hey, get your head off the desk!

*Zen-Master Greg*: Yet my head is on my hands.

*Customer A*: So?

*Zen-Master Greg*: I fear that were I to release my hands they might move of
their own accord.

*Customer A*: You're really strange. And the music is crap, too.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Your wisdom belies your countenance.

*Customer A*: What's that?

*Zen-Master Greg*: You look very intelligent.

*Customer A*: Oh. Right. Look, those ftp-sites you gave us weren't any good.

*Zen-Master Greg*: And why not?

*Customer A*: Well, my friend wants this game, and it wan't on any of them.

*Zen-Master Greg*: And the name of this game?

*Customer A*: Magic.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Ah, but that is a commercial game, and you could not want a
site containing that, FOR THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL WITH THE PENALTY FOR DOWNLOADING
CONSISTING OF CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES INCLUDING FINES OF $100 000.

*Customer A*: Okay, okay, okay. And could you lower your voice? All these people
are staring.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Indeed. Truly the world is vexing. Now you must go and tell
your friend that WHAT HE WANTS IS ILLEGAL AND HE SHOULD STOP TRYING TO DO IT AT
ONCE.

*Customer A*: Okay, okay. Just be quiet. I'm going.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Now you begin to see enlightenment.

(30 minutes pass)

*Zen-Master Greg*: Nothing can stop me now, 'cause I don't care anymore.

*Customer A*: Hi again.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Nothing can stop me now, 'cause I don't care.

*Customer A*: Excuse me for being rude, but that music is bugging the shit out
of me. Can you turn it off?

*Zen-Master Greg*: I shall do as you ask, O one who is as a moth entranced by
the flame of enlightenment.

(30 minutes later)

*Brother Mike*: Hi Greg, how's it... Jesus Christ! Why's the music up so loud?
GREG, WHAT'S WITH THE MUSIC? Hell, I'll just turn it down.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Greetings, fellow seeker of enlightenment.

*Brother Mike*: Why was the music so loud? And why do you have bits of paper in
your ears?

*Zen-Master Greg*: Forgive me, but could you repeat the question once I have
removed the paper?

*Brother Mike*: Why on earth was the music so loud?

*Zen-Master Greg*: I had great need.

*Brother Mike*: Didn't the customers complain?

*Zen-Master Greg*: Truly they did not. Indeed, they asked for it.

*Brother Mike*: Really?

*Zen-Master Greg*: Truly. They even tapped on the door in time to some of the
more enlightening passages.

*Brother Mike*: That door over there?

*Zen-Master Greg*: You speak with wisdom.

*Brother Mike*: That closed door? The locked one?

*Zen-Master Greg*: Truth is strong within you. I closed and locked the when it
appeared the glass might shake loose.

*Brother Mike*: Are you going to let them out?

*Zen-Master Greg*: Is it not that there exists nothing eternal?

*Brother Mike*: It is so.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Then even that which we wish were forever must end.

(60 minutes pass)

*Zen-Master Greg*: Greetings, O customers. Might I ask you to leave now, as the
Sage has asked me to run the assimilator program before I leave.

*Customer B*: But it's not 7pm yet.

*Zen-Master Greg*: It is truth you speak, yet time is an illusion, and I wish to
leave now.

*Customer A*: Well we're not going until 7pm. You can get stuffed. I'm going to
finish this game.

*Zen-Master Greg*: You are aware of the notion of karma, grasshopper.

*Customer A*: Yeah, so what?

*Zen-Master Greg*: Enlightenment will come.

*Customer B*: Ah, are you kicking those chairs for a reason?

*Zen-Master Greg*: Order is of benefit to the universe. I am placing them
according to pattern and availing myself of catharsis.

*Customer B*: But you're kicking them across the room.

*Zen-Master Greg*: The patterns of the universe are indeed strange, and not to
be understood by those who are as unworthy pustules upon the buttocks of the
Buddha.

(5 minutes pass)

*Zen-Master Greg*: As time is measured, it is now 7pm.

*Customer A*: Okay, just one more life.

*Zen-Master Greg*: That life may not be long.

*Customer B*: Oh, he's really good at this game.

*Zen-Master Greg*: The unenlightened listen, but do not hear.

*Customer A*: Damn. Well, that's it.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Even the worst agony must end.

*Customer A*: Okay, we're out of here. Oh, one small thing.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Yes, O gnat?

*Customer A*: I've got some files on this machine that I haven't saved to disk.
Can I just leave them on there?

*Zen-Master Greg*: As long as they are on the illuminated temp directory, there
is no problem.

*Customer A*: They're on the hard drive, actually. There wasn't enough space on
temp.

*Zen-Master Greg*: Yet the most excellent temp directory has a capacity of 15
meg.

*Customer A*: Well I started downloading this stuff via the web and it didn't
fit.

*Zen-Master Greg*: You downloaded this stuff over the mysterious web, the cosmic
nature of which is such that this facility gets billed for each megabyte
downloaded.

*Customer A*: Yeah. So can you take care of it?

*Zen-Master Greg*: The files shall be taken care of.

*Customer A*: Thanks a lot. Oh, and if you can tell Pete that that mail I sent
him about you doesn't count?

*Zen-Master Greg*: It shall be as though the mail never reached him.

*Customer A*: Okay. See you later.

not return*

Slight format change with this one, because it's more of a trailer for the next
one (#5) than a new one in itself, and I wanted to muck around with things a
bit. So this should be more cinegraphic. Not nearly as funny, but that's for the
real release (which should be a week or two). This is basically how I'd direct
the trailer for the movie version of (#5) (if John Woo wasn't available).

 [opens with shot of a crowded lecture theatre, with students absolutely
 everywhere, all looking towards the front of the room, where a lecturer
 (reasonably old) is droning on in a monotone]

*Voiceover:* The start of another boring year, and already I'm in another bloody
lecture. I can deal with that though. I can also deal with all the law students
(though this is harder). Unfortunately, things don't stop there. You see, I've
got this pain in my stomach.

[shot close in one one particular student, who's slightly bent over, grimacing,
and wincing occasionally.]

*Voiceover:* This isn't just a stomachache, however, and it's not going to go
away. You see, there's a Zen Master inside me, and he wants to get out.

*Master's voice:* Come, Greg, let me out.

*VO*: No. Not anymore. Not this year. I've finished all that. I'm back at law.

*Master:* Oh come now. Look around you. Don't you feel the urge to lay about
with the sledgehammer of enlightenment? To show these poor cretins what a
conflict of ideas really is?

*VO*: No. Not even a little bit.

*Master:* Or are you really a law student?

*VO*: You take that back? Now.

*Master:* Or what law-boy? You can't do anything to me. I'm part of you.
Remember the gym the other day? When you broke the punching bag again? Didn't it
feel good?

*VO*: Um, yeah, but that was only because I hadn't hit anything in a week.

*Master:* Ah, but remember back a few years to when that luser came in, and you
told her that you couldn't convert her text file because you were playing
nethack? Then when she retyped all two thousand you deleted the file from the
shared directory just as she was saving it? Converting all two thousand words
into conjunctions of question marks? Remember that?

*VO*: Oh yeah.

*Master:* Don't you want to do it again?

*VO*: Yes! I mean no, I mean...

*Master:* Come child, we have work to do, enlightenment to bring. Look around
you. Look at all these law students. These belly-crawling slime. They need you.

*Voiceover [to audience]:* I think about it, and the more I think about it, the
more right it seems. So many law students, so few resources. This is a task that
requires help. Philosophical help. I really don't have any option. Plus I'm sick
of the pain. I let the Master out, and we go to work.

[Screen fades to black, then a saffron robe (empty) is imposed upon the
blackness. Underneath is the title (in red) "Tales of the Master#5: In which the
Master lays down the law". Excerpts follow, to the backing music of the first
Piggy mix from NIN's FDTS#2.]

[First excerpt, during the slow intital opening of the song, is of The Master
walking into a lecture theatre (half-full from the front) and sitting down (at
the very back). Suddenly all these students rush in (half carrying laptops)
jostling The Master, accidentally hitting him with elbows etc. Master has a
strange half-smile.]

[Next cut (also during the slow part) is of signing up for tutorial groups.
Master walks into empty room containing tute lists, reaches to pick one up, then
a voice is heard, "Hey, the tute lists are out". Swarms of people rush in,
pushing past The Master, and he is left watching a sea of individuals squabbling
over the lists. They leave, and The Master discovers every tute is fully signed
up, except for the ones that start before 8am.]

[Song switches to the fast, angry bit. Shot of The Master grabbing the laptop of
the person next to him, and heaving it a particularly idiotic yuppie-wannabe in
ther front row that has just asked the same question again. Owner of the laptop
turns to The Master (looking outraged) and The Master picks up a disk (from the
person on his other side), and jams it down the throat of this individual.
There's a cry of "but I don't have backups" from the other side.]

[Various scenes of bloody carnage to law students, law lecturers and computing
equipment follow, fast-cutting between them all. The Master is a whirling
dervish of destruction.]

[Music suddenly ceases, there's a close up shot of The Master (with a robe now
pretty-much red and brown), and he simply asks, "Do you know what the Buddha
looks like?". Cut to black.]

*Mike:* Hi Greg, how's it going?

*Greg:* This is not a question that may be easily answered. My work here is done, but...

*Mike:* But what?

*Greg:* I hesitate to speak of it.

*Mike:* WHAT?

*Greg:* I have a lecture.

*Mike:* Is that all?

*Greg:* It's a law lecture.

*Mike:* You have a law lecture?

*Greg:* Yes.

*Mike:* Ooo. Are you sure you're ready to go back?

 (The Master walks into a three-quarter fulled lecture theatre, with the rows
 filled from the front. Seeing all the people, he looks down at his watch. It's
 ten minutes to the hour. The Master sighs, and takes a seat in the very back
 row, which is empty)

(5 minutes pass)

*Brother Charles:* Greg! You're at a lecture.

*Zen-Master Greg:* It is the case.

*Brother Charles:* It's good to see you again.

*Zen-Master Greg:* It is good to be back. I fear that I may have grown soft
during my time in the halls of philosophy. It is time to quench myself in fire
once again.

*Brother Charles:* Um, yeah. Whatever.

(Brother Charles gets up to leave)

*Zen-Master Greg:* Where are you going?

*Brother Charles:* You are at a law lecture. You will take notes. I am no longer
needed here.

*Zen-Master Greg:* Indeed. Are you enrolled in admin law?

*Brother Charles:* This is so.

*Zen-Master Greg:* Then I shall not be there.

*Brother Charles:* Truly, you follow the path.

(They bow to each other, and Brother Charles leaves)

(Suddenly a mob of law students rush in. Half are dressed in (bad) suits, and
the other half are dressed in casual surf clothing. Almost all are carrying
laptops. They race for the back row, and the one available power outlet, which
is directly behind the Master. When they get to the outlet they fight over who
gets to plug in their laptop, causing the Master's seat to be jostled against
the desk. Finally, one being successful, they sit down on either side of the
Master. Throughout this process, the Master's expression does not change. He is,
however, rotating the fingers on each hand, one by one, methodically.)

*Student A:* Can I have a go on your laptop?

*Student B:* No. I'm using it.

*Student A:* But you're just playing a game.

*Student B:* No I'm not. Besides, there isn't time.

*Student A:* Prick. Woah!

*Student B:* What?

*Student A:* That guy's wearing a robe.

*Student B:* You're kidding. Where?

*Student A:* Beside you. Hey man, cool robe. Very black.

*Student B:* Yeah. Way cool.

(The Master says nothing, but continues to rotate his fingers)

*Student A:* So is that like a kilt?

*Student B:* Huh?

(The Master looks faintly puzzled)

*Student A:* Do you wear anything underneath it?

*Student B:* Oh. Yeah, what's under the robe?

(The Master has switched to forming a fist with one hand, hitting the opposite
palm, and then repeating with the other hand, very fast)

*Student A:* Come on Mr X. I want to know. What's under the robe.

(Student A reaches out to grab the robe of the Master, and the Master grabs the
reaching hand by the wrist. The face of student A begins to change colour)

*Student B:* Hey, all he wants to know is what's under the robe.

*Zen-Master Greg:* Pain. Would you like some?

*Student B:* No, no that's quite all right. Don't trouble yourself.

*Zen-Master Greg:* There is no burden in the teaching of the way.

*Student B:* Um... ah... oh here's the lecturer. No time to learn. Maybe next
time.

*Zen-Master Greg:* I shall look forward to it.

(The Master releases that hand of Student A)

(5 minutes pass)

*Student A:* So what's your name anyway?

(The Master says nothing)

*Student A:* I said, what's your name?

*Zen-Master Greg:* I heard.

*Student A:* So what is it?

*Zen-Master Greg:* You may call me...

*Student A:* What?

(The Master says nothing)

*Student A:* Come on, what did you say?

*Zen-Master Greg:* Are you referring to me?

*Student A:* Obviously. You said that I can call you... and then I didn't hear
the rest.

*Zen-Master Greg:* My most humble apologies. You may call me...

*Student A:* But what did you say?

*Zen-Master Greg:* I said...

*Student A:* But you keep saying you'll tell me your name and then you don't say
anything.

*Zen-Master Greg:* Precisely.

*Student A:* I don't understand.

*Zen-Master Greg:* Yes.

*Student A:* Why won't you tell me what to call you.

*Zen-Master Greg:* But I have. I have told you to call me nothing.

*Student A:* Come again?

*Zen-Master Greg:* You will call me nothing because you have nothing of interest
to say. Experiencing enlightenment, you shall realise this, and cease to trouble
those who are as spiritual oxen to your spiritual dung fly.

*Student A:* But how do you know I don't have anything to say?

*Zen-Master Greg:* In the same fashion as I know not to expect wise discourse
from the ant, the cockroach, and those that dislike Leonard Cohen.

*Student A:* Huh?

*Zen-Master Greg:* Their natures forbid wisdom. As does yours. You are a law
student.

*Student A:* But so are you.

*Zen-Master Greg:* Incorrect. Law students are eager. They race into lectures
ten minutes early. They wear suits to lectures out of choice. They carry around
laptops without knowing how to use them. They leave the same laptops lying
around since they think that no one would bother to steal them because "everyone
has one". They take no notice of what is said and they ask stupid questions.
Repeatedly.

*Student B:* So if you're not a law student, what are you doing here?

*Zen-Master Greg:* I am not a law student. I do, however, study law.

*Student A:* That's crap, and you're an arrogant prick.

*Zen-Master Greg:* Do you know what the Buddha looks like?

*Student A:* No. Why?

*Zen-Master Greg:* Because it is said, "If you meet the Buddha travelling down
the road, kill him".

*Student A:* And?

*Zen-Master Greg:* I also do not know what the Buddha looks like. So I am forced
to guess. And you appear to be convinced of your own enlightenment.

*Student A:* So you're going to kill me? Yeah, right.

*Zen-Master Greg:* Philosophy demands it.

*Student A:* You're full of it. For one thing it's illegal. You know, murder?
Those who study law do read the Criminal Code, I take it?

*Zen-Master Greg:* Which is subject to the constitution. Which guarantees
freedom of religion. Fortunately, Zen is realised as philosophy _and_ religion.

*Student A:* That'll never work.

*Zen-Master Greg:* Possibly. Certainly a test case would appear required to
settle the matter.

*Student A:* But that would mean...

*Zen-Master Greg:* Your insight is masterful.

*Student A:* AAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!

*Student B:* OH MY... HEY! KEEP AWAY FROM ME!

<The sound of something being forcibly ingested>

(As the screams echo through the crowded lecture theatre, the lecturer's drone
ceases abruptly, and all heads bent over work rapidly rise and turn towards the
back. The Master innocently returns the stares directed his way. On one side of
the Master sits a student looking ill, whilst the seat on the other side would
appear unoccupied)

*Lecturer:* Is there some problem down the back?

*Zen-Master Greg:* There is no problem.

*Lecturer:* Then what was that noise?

*Zen-Master Greg:* Problem resolution.

*Lecturer:* Oh.

(The lecture continues)

(The Master leans forward and taps the shoulder of the student in front of him)

*Zen-Master Greg:* Might I borrow a tissue?

*Student C:* Sure. Do you have a cold too?

*Zen-Master Greg:* Not exactly.

(The Master takes the proffered tissue, and wipes his fingers with it, before
screwing it up and throwing it into the bin. He receives a puzzled look from
student C, who also looks oddly at the green Student B)

*Student C:* Is your friend okay?

*Zen-Master Greg:* It's just that he ate something disagreeable. I grant that he
was morose earlier, but action has been taken. Indeed, I can now guarantee he
contains the humour of two people.

*Student C:* Oh, right. What was that on your fingers, by the way.

*Zen-Master Greg:* Merely something disagreeable.

*Student C:* Oh, okay.

(The lecture continues. Student B doesn't do much except look straight ahead,
although he occasionally looks quickly at the Master before looking away again.
The Master stares serenely ahead. Then the lecturer is interrupted by a
question. He gives a long and complicated answer. The speaker then asks the same
question again. The lecturer answers again, this time in a simpler fashion. The
speaker then asks the same question again, re phrased. The lecturer answers yet
again, in language so simple that a child could understand)

*Student D:* But it _can't_ work like that. I couldn't do that and get away with
it.

*Lecturer:* As I've explained, international law operates on different
principles from municipal law. You can't act that way because you're not a
country.

*Student D:* But it just _can't_ work that way. It's wrong. It shouldn't happen.

*Zen-Master Greg:* Excuse me.

*Student D:* Yes.

*Zen-Master Greg:* You've asked the same question three times, and rejected
three factually equivalent answers on the basis of your personal moral
convictions as to how the law should operate. If you really need to discuss
this, could you do so after the lecture when the rest us have left?

*Student D:* No. I don't understand and I want an answer now. If you can't give
me an answer, just shut up and let me talk to someone who can.

*Zen-Master Greg:* Oh my child, I have an answer for you.

*Student D:* Well let's have it then.

*Zen-Master Greg:* Who am I to deny enlightenment? As you will.

(The Master reaches towards student B, who screams out "NO! NOT ME AS WELL!" and
covers his eyes with his hands. The Master, however, simply takes the now
unsecured laptop of Student B, and then hurls it at the head of Student D. The
impromptu missile lands neatly in the (widely) open mouth of Student D, who is
flung backwards (with his chair) by the force of the impact. All that remains to
be seen are the feet of Student D, which are sticking straight up. They twitch.
Several of the more bored-looking students perk up, and clap politely. The
Master stands and bows)

*Zen-Master Greg:* A true answer is one which denies the possibility of further
questions.

(Those clapping rise and bow to the Master)

*Lecturer:* My God! What's going on here! You!

*Zen-Master Greg:* Yes?

*Lecturer:* What kind of violent savage are you?

*Zen-Master Greg:* A perfectly enlightened one, my child.

*Lecturer:* Well I've had enough of your 'perfect enlightenment'! Get out! Your
days in this faculty are numbered!

*Zen-Master Greg:* Indeed? Tell me, for it seems necessary to inquire. Do you
 know what the Buddha looks like?
* The Tao of Programming

** Book 1 -- The Silent Void
---------
 Thus spake the master programmer:

 #+begin_quote
"When you have learned to snatch the error code from the trap frame, it will be
time for you to leave."
#+end_quote
---------
Something mysterious is formed, born in the silent void. Waiting alone and
unmoving, it is at once still and yet in constant motion. It is the source of
all programs. I do not know its name, so I will call it the Tao of Programming.

If the Tao is great, then the operating system is great. If the operating system
is great, then the compiler is great. If the compiler is great, then the
application is great. The user is pleased and there exists harmony in the world.

The Tao of Programming flows far away and returns on the wind of morning.
--------
The Tao gave birth to machine language. Machine language gave birth to the
assembler.

The assembler gave birth to the compiler. Now there are ten thousand languages.

Each language has its purpose, however humble. Each language expresses the Yin
and Yang of software. Each language has its place within the Tao.

But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.
--------
In the beginning was the Tao. The Tao gave birth to Space and Time. Therefore
Space and Time are Yin and Yang of programming.

Programmers that do not comprehend the Tao are always running out of time and
space for their programs. Programmers that comprehend the Tao always have enough
time and space to accomplish their goals.

How could it be otherwise?
----------
The wise programmer is told about Tao and follows it. The average programmer is
told about Tao and searches for it. The foolish programmer is told about Tao
and laughs at it.

If it were not for laughter, there would be no Tao.

#+begin_verse
The highest sounds are hardest to hear.
Going forward is a way to retreat.
Great talent shows itself late in life.
Even a perfect program still has bugs.
#+end_verse
----------
** Book 2 -- The Ancient Masters
 Thus spake the master programmer:

#+begin_quote
"After three days without programming, life becomes meaningless."
#+end_quote
--------
 The programmers of old were mysterious and profound. We cannot fathom their thoughts, so all we do is describe their appearance.

Aware, like a fox crossing the water. Alert, like a general on the battlefield. Kind, like a hostess greeting her guests. Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood. Opaque, like black pools in darkened caves.

Who can tell the secrets of their hearts and minds?

The answer exists only in Tao.
----------
 Grand Master Turing once dreamed that he was a machine. When he awoke he
 exclaimed:
 #+begin_quote
 I don't know whether I am Turing dreaming that I am a machine, or a machine
 dreaming that I am Turing!
 #+end_quote
 ---------
  A programmer from a very large computer company went to a software conference
  and then returned to report to his manager, saying: "What sort of programmers
  work for other companies? They behaved badly and were unconcerned with
  appearances. Their hair was long and unkempt and their clothes were wrinkled
  and old. They crashed our hospitality suite and they made rude noises during
  my presentation."

The manager said: "I should have never sent you to the conference. Those
programmers live beyond the physical world. They consider life absurd, an
accidental coincidence. They come and go without knowing limitations. Without a
care, they live only for their programs. Why should they bother with social
conventions?

#+begin_quote
"They are alive within the Tao."
#+end_quote
--------
 A novice asked the Master: "Here is a programmer that never designs, documents
 or tests his programs. Yet all who know him consider him one of the best
 programmers in the world. Why is this?"

The Master replies: "That programmer has mastered the Tao. He has gone beyond
the need for design; he does not become angry when the system crashes, but
accepts the universe without concern. He has gone beyond the need for
documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else sees his code. He has gone
beyond the need for testing; each of his programs are perfect within themselves,
serene and elegant, their purpose self-evident. Truly, he has entered the
mystery of Tao."
----------
** Book 3 -- Design
 Thus spake the master programmer:
#+begin_quote
"When the program is being tested, it is too late to make design changes."
#+end_quote
---------
 There once was a man who went to a computer trade show. Each day as he entered,
 the man told the guard at the door:

 #+begin_quote
 "I am a great thief, renowned for my feats of shoplifting. Be forewarned, for
 this trade show shall not escape unplundered."
 #+end_quote

This speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were millions of dollars
of computer equipment inside, so he watched the man carefully. But the man
merely wandered from booth to booth, humming quietly to himself.

When the man left, the guard took him aside and searched his clothes, but
nothing was to be found.

On the next day of the trade show, the man returned and chided the guard saying:
"I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will be even better." So the
guard watched him ever more closely, but to no avail.

On the final day of the trade show, the guard could restrain his curiosity no
longer. "Sir Thief," he said, "I am so perplexed, I cannot live in peace. Please
enlighten me. What is it that you are stealing?"

The man smiled. "I am stealing ideas," he said.
---------
There once was a master programmer who wrote unstructured programs. A novice
programmer, seeking to imitate him, also began to write unstructured programs.
When the novice asked the master to evaluate his progress, the master criticized
him for writing unstructured programs, saying, "What is appropriate for the
master is not appropriate for the novice. You must understand the Tao before
transcending structure."
----------
 There was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the warlord of Wu.
 The warlord asked the programmer: "Which is easier to design: an accounting
 package or an operating system?"

"An operating system," replied the programmer.

The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief. "Surely an accounting package
is trivial next to the complexity of an operating system," he said.

"Not so," said the programmer, "when designing an accounting package, the
programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas: how it
must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to the tax
laws. By contrast, an operating system is not limited by outside appearances.
When designing an operating system, the programmer seeks the simplest harmony
between machine and ideas. This is why an operating system is easier to design."

The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled. "That is all good and well, but which is
easier to debug?"

The programmer made no reply.
-------------
 A manager went to the master programmer and showed him the requirements
 document for a new application. The manager asked the master: "How long will it
 take to design this system if I assign five programmers to it?"

"It will take one year," said the master promptly.

"But we need this system immediately or even sooner! How long will it take if I
assign ten programmers to it?"

The master programmer frowned. "In that case, it will take two years."

"And what if I assign a hundred programmers to it?"

The master programmer shrugged. "Then the design will never be completed," he
said.
-------------
** Book 4 -- Coding
Thus spake the master programmer:
#+begin_quote
"A well-written program is its own heaven; a poorly-written program is its own hell."
#+end_quote
--------
 A program should be light and agile, its subroutines connected like a string of
 pearls. The spirit and intent of the program should be retained throughout.
 There should be neither too little or too much, neither needless loops nor
 useless variables, neither lack of structure nor overwhelming rigidity.

A program should follow the "Law of Least Astonishment". What is this law? It is
simply that the program should always respond to the user in the way that
astonishes him least.

A program, no matter how complex, should act as a single unit. The program
should be directed by the logic within rather than by outward appearances.

If the program fails in these requirements, it will be in a state of disorder
and confusion. The only way to correct this is to rewrite the program.
----------
 A novice asked the master: "I have a program that sometime runs and sometimes
 aborts. I have followed the rules of programming, yet I am totally baffled.
 What is the reason for this?"

The master replied: "You are confused because you do not understand Tao. Only a
fool expects rational behavior from his fellow humans. Why do you expect it from
a machine that humans have constructed? Computers simulate determinism; only Tao
is perfect.

"The rules of programming are transitory; only Tao is eternal. Therefore you
must contemplate Tao before you receive enlightenment."

"But how will I know when I have received enlightenment?" asked the novice.

"Your program will then run correctly," replied the master.
--------------
 A master was explaining the nature of Tao of to one of his novices. "The Tao is
 embodied in all software - regardless of how insignificant," said the master.

"Is the Tao in a hand-held calculator?" asked the novice.

"It is," came the reply.

"Is the Tao in a video game?" continued the novice.

"It is even in a video game," said the master.

"And is the Tao in the DOS for a personal computer?"

The master coughed and shifted his position slightly. "The lesson is over for
today," he said.
-----------
 Prince Wang"s programmer was coding software. His fingers danced upon the
 keyboard. The program compiled without an error message, and the program ran
 like a gentle wind.

"Excellent!" the Prince exclaimed, "Your technique is faultless!"

"Technique?" said the programmer turning from his terminal, "What I follow is
Tao - beyond all techniques! When I first began to program I would see before me
the whole problem in one mass. After three years I no longer saw this mass.
Instead, I used subroutines. But now I see nothing. My whole being exists in a
formless void. My senses are idle. My spirit, free to work without plan, follows
its own instinct. In short, my program writes itself. True, sometimes there are
difficult problems. I see them coming, I slow down, I watch silently. Then I
change a single line of code and the difficulties vanish like puffs of idle
smoke. I then compile the program. I sit still and let the joy of the work fill
my being. I close my eyes for a moment and then log off."

Prince Wang said, "Would that all of my programmers were as wise!"
--------
** Book 5 -- Maintenance
 Thus spake the master programmer:

 #+begin_src
"Though a program be but three lines long, someday it will have to be maintained."
#+end_src
----------
#+begin_verse
A well-used door needs no oil on its hinges.
A swift-flowing stream does not grow stagnant.
Neither sound nor thoughts can travel through a vacuum.
Software rots if not used.
#+end_verse

These are great mysteries.
------------
 A manager asked a programmer how long it would take him to finish the program on which he was working. "It will be finished tomorrow," the programmer promptly replied.

"I think you are being unrealistic," said the manager, "Truthfully, how long will it take?"

The programmer thought for a moment. "I have some features that I wish to add. This will take at least two weeks," he finally said.

"Even that is too much to expect," insisted the manager, "I will be satisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete."

The programmer agreed to this.

Several years later, the manager retired. On the way to his retirement luncheon, he discovered the programmer asleep at his terminal. He had been programming all night.
---------------
 A novice programmer was once assigned to code a simple financial package.

The novice worked furiously for many days, but when his master reviewed his
program, he discovered that it contained a screen editor, a set of generalized
graphics routines, an artificial intelligence interface, but not the slightest
mention of anything financial.

When the master asked about this, the novice became indignant. "Don't be so
impatient," he said, "I'll put in the financial stuff eventually."
----------
#+begin_verse
Does a good farmer neglect a crop he has planted?
Does a good teacher overlook even the most humble student?
Does a good father allow a single child to starve?
Does a good programmer refuse to maintain his code?
#+end_verse
---------
** Book 6 -- Management
 Thus spake the master programmer:

 #+begin_quote
 "Let the programmers be many and the managers few - then all will be productive."
 #+end_quote
 ----------
 When managers hold endless meetings, the programmers write games. When
 accountants talk of quarterly profits, the development budget is about to be
 cut. When senior scientists talk blue sky, the clouds are about to roll in.

 Truly, this is not the Tao of Programming.

 When managers make commitments, game programs are ignored. When accountants make
 long-range plans, harmony and order are about to be restored. When senior
 scientists address the problems at hand, the problems will soon be solved.

 Truly, this is the Tao of Programming.
 ----------
 Why are programmers non-productive?  Because their time is wasted in meetings.

 Why are programmers rebellious?  Because the management interferes too much.

 Why are the programmers resigning one by one?  Because they are burnt out.

 Having worked for poor management, they no longer value their jobs.
 ----------------
 A manager was about to be fired, but a programmer who worked for him invented a
 new program that became popular and sold well. As a result, the manager
 retained his job.

 The manager tried to give the programmer a bonus, but the programmer refused it,
 saying, "I wrote the program because I thought it was an interesting concept,
 and thus I expect no reward."

 The manager upon hearing this remarked, "This programmer, though he holds a
 position of small esteem, understands well the proper duty of an employee. Let
 us promote him to the exalted position of management consultant!"

 But when told this, the programmer once more refused, saying, "I exist so that I
 can program. If I were promoted, I would do nothing but waste everyone"s time.
 Can I go now? I have a program that I"m working on."
 ---------------
 A manager went to his programmers and told them: "As regards to your work
 hours: you are going to have to come in at nine in the morning and leave at
 five in the afternoon." At this, all of them became angry and several resigned
 on the spot.

 So the manager said: "All right, in that case you may set your own working
 hours, as long as you finish your projects on schedule." The programmers, now
 satisfied, began to come in at noon and work to the wee hours of the morning.
 -------------
** Book 7 -- Corporate Wisdom
 Thus spake the master programmer:

 #+begin_quote
"You can demonstrate a program for a corporate executive, but you can't make him computer literate."
#+end_quote
 ---------------
 A novice asked the master: "In the east there is a great tree-structure that
 men call "Corporate Headquarters". It is bloated out of shape with vice
 presidents and accountants. It issues a multitude of memos, each saying "Go,
 Hence!" or "Go, Hither!" and nobody knows what is meant. Every year new names
 are put onto the branches, but all to no avail. How can such an unnatural
 entity be?"

 The master replied: "You perceive this immense structure and are disturbed that
 it has no rational purpose. Can you not take amusement from its endless
 gyrations? Do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of programming beneath its
 sheltering branches? Why are you bothered by its uselessness?"
 --------
 In the east there is a shark which is larger than all other fish. It changes
 into a bird whose wings are like clouds filling the sky. When this bird moves
 across the land, it brings a message from Corporate Headquarters. This message
 it drops into the midst of the programmers, like a seagull making its mark upon
 the beach. Then the bird mounts on the wind and, with the blue sky at its back,
 returns home.

 The novice programmer stares in wonder at the bird, for he understands it not.
 The average programmer dreads the coming of the bird, for he fears its message.
 The master programmer continues to work at his terminal, for he does not know
 that the bird has come and gone.
 --------------
 The Magician of the Ivory Tower brought his latest invention for the master
 programmer to examine. The magician wheeled a large black box into the master"s
 office while the master waited in silence.

 "This is an integrated, distributed, general-purpose workstation," began the
 magician, "ergonomically designed with a proprietary operating system, sixth
 generation languages, and multiple state of the art user interfaces. It took my
 assistants several hundred man years to construct. Is it not amazing?"

 The master raised his eyebrows slightly. "It is indeed amazing," he said.

 "Corporate Headquarters has commanded," continued the magician, "that everyone
 use this workstation as a platform for new programs. Do you agree to this?"

 "Certainly," replied the master, "I will have it transported to the data center
 immediately!" And the magician returned to his tower, well pleased.

 Several days later, a novice wandered into the office of the master programmer
 and said, "I cannot find the listing for my new program. Do you know where it
 might be?"

 "Yes," replied the master, "the listings are stacked on the platform in the data
 center."
 ------------
 The master programmer moves from program to program without fear. No change in
 management can harm him. He will not be fired, even if the project is cancelled.
 Why is this? He is filled with Tao.
 ------------
** Book 8 -- Hardware and Software
 Thus spake the master programmer:
#+begin_quote
``Without the wind, the grass does not move. Without software, hardware is useless.''
#+end_quote
-------------
 A novice asked the master: "I perceive that one computer company is much larger
 than all others. It towers above its competition like a giant among dwarfs. Any
 one of its divisions could comprise an entire business. Why is this so?"

The master replied, "Why do you ask such foolish questions? That company is
large because it is large. If it only made hardware, nobody would buy it. If it
only made software, nobody would use it. If it only maintained systems, people
would treat it like a servant. But because it combines all of these things,
people think it one of the gods! By not seeking to strive, it conquers without
effort."
-------------
 A master programmer passed a novice programmer one day. The master noted the
 novice"s preoccupation with a hand-held computer game. "Excuse me," he said,
 "may I examine it?"

The novice bolted to attention and handed the device to the master. "I see that
the device claims to have three levels of play: Easy, Medium, and Hard," said
the master. "Yet every such device has another level of play, where the device
seeks not to conquer the human, nor to be conquered by the human."

"Pray, great master," implored the novice, "how does one find this mysterious
setting?"

The master dropped the device to the ground and crushed it underfoot. And
suddenly the novice was enlightened.
------------
 There was once a programmer who worked upon microprocessors. "Look at how well
 off I am here," he said to a mainframe programmer who came to visit, "I have my
 own operating system and file storage device. I do not have to share my
 resources with anyone. The software is self- consistent and easy-to-use. Why do
 you not quit your present job and join me here?"

The mainframe programmer then began to describe his system to his friend, saying
"The mainframe sits like an ancient sage meditating in the midst of the data
center. Its disk drives lie end-to-end like a great ocean of machinery. The
software is as multifaceted as a diamond, and as convoluted as a primeval
jungle. The programs, each unique, move through the system like a swift-flowing
river. That is why I am happy where I am."

The microcomputer programmer, upon hearing this, fell silent. But the two
programmers remained friends until the end of their days.
-------------
 Hardware met Software on the road to Changtse. Software said: "You are Yin and
 I am Yang. If we travel together we will become famous and earn vast sums of
 money." And so the set forth together, thinking to conquer the world.

Presently they met Firmware, who was dressed in tattered rags and hobbled along
propped on a thorny stick. Firmware said to them: "The Tao lies beyond Yin and
Yang. It is silent and still as a pool of water. It does not seek fame,
therefore nobody knows its presence. It does not seek fortune, for it is
complete within itself. It exists beyond space and time."

Software and Hardware, ashamed, returned to their homes.
----------
** Book 9 -- Epilogue
 Thus spake the master programmer:
#+begin_quote
"It is time for you to leave."
#+end_quote
