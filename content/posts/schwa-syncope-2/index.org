* Schwa deletion in Hindi is so pervasive, people don't notice when you are not supposed to drop them.

(You should also read this [[/posts/syncope][previous post]])


I have been repeatedly listening to Heeramandi's rendition of Sakal Ban on Apple music for a while now because I really like it.

However, for whatever reason, someone has replaced all the lyrics from
Devanagari to a Latin transliteration with a very non standard romanisation
scheme.

Not only is the transliteration wrong, it is also very inconsistent.

A few mistakes that are immediately obvious are things like:

1. The singers are clearly not singing 'Sakal Ban', they are saying 'सकल बन'
   With the final schwa. (This is what moved me to write this post btw.)
2. Assuming the guy who wrote the transliterated lyrics is deaf and assumed that
   since modern Hindi drops its schwas, a dialect spoken in the 17^th century
   will also do the same; they still chose to transcribe 'अम्बवा' as 'Ambava'
   (lines 4 and 5) with an 'a' after the 'b' thus creating an ambiguity between
   the final long 'a' and the initial and medial schwas.
   - I would be less enranged if they stuck to this convention and going back to
     point (1) chose to write 'Sakal Ban' as 'Sakala Bana'. This wouldn't even
     create any ambiguity in vowel length since all the vowels in those 2 words
     are schwas.
   - Of course this convention is immediately broken in line 7 when they chose
     to write 'आई' as 'aai' instead of 'ai'.
3. They choose to write 'फूल' as 'Fool', but 'फूटे' as 'Phute'.
   - फ' is pronouced /pʰ/, although it is allophonic to a /f/ in modern use,
     using 2 different transcription schemes for the same sound is strange.
   - The same can be said about the vowel, they both have a /uː/ and yet there
     is 'Fool' and 'Phute'.

This pattern of inconsistencies continues throughout the song.

I guess this is symptomatic of a larger issue where Hindi speakers love to
pretend that Hindi is absolutely a phonetic language even though it is
absolutely not (I am a Hindi speaker btw). This leads to incidents like these
(This article also gives a pretty nice explaination of the final schwa problem
so read that I guess).

Uhhhhhhh I don't really have anything else to say so uhh this is the end.
